# SmartLIB
The project explores the emerging automatic identification technology to facilitate fast issuing, renewing and returning of books with the help of RFID enabled modules. The proposed system will automate the following tasks using RFID technology :

1. To remove manual book keeping of library records. 
2. Managing the access of only a particular number of books at a given time by any student.
3. Searching a particular book to check its presence in the library.
4. Locating the physical location (rack/shelf number) of the book in the library.
5. Traceability of book allocation on the shelves, thus reducing misplacement and/or missing books in the library.
6. Automatic reminders before 24 hours of book's return due-date to avoid late penalty fees to be paid by students.
7. Tracking total late-book-return penalty amount for any student.
